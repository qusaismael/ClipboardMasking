git clone https://github.com/qusaismael/ClipboardMasking.git
cd ClipboardMasking
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open ClipboardMasking.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run the project (⌘+R)

4. The app will appear in your menu bar with an eye-slash icon

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Start Monitoring**: Click the menu bar icon and press "Start Monitoring"
2. **Copy Sensitive Data**: Copy any text containing sensitive information
3. **Automatic Masking**: The app automatically replaces sensitive data with placeholders
4. **Restore if Needed**: Use "Restore Last Content" to get back the original text

### Menu Bar Icon States

- **Gray eye-slash**: Monitoring is inactive
- **Green eye-slash**: Monitoring is active

### Quick Settings

Access common masking options directly from the main menu:
- ✅ IP Addresses
- ✅ Emails  
- ✅ Phone Numbers
- ✅ Credit Cards

### Advanced Settings

Click "Settings" to access advanced configuration:

#### Masking Options
- **IP Addresses**: Masks IPv4 addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1` → `[IP_ADDRESS]`)
- **Email Addresses**: Masks email formats (e.g., `user@example.com` → `[EMAIL]`)
- **Phone Numbers**: Masks US phone number formats (e.g., `(555) 123-4567` → `[PHONE]`)
- **Credit Card Numbers**: Masks 13-16 digit card numbers (e.g., `1234 5678 9012 3456` → `[CARD_NUMBER]`)
- **Social Security Numbers**: Masks SSN format (e.g., `123-45-6789` → `[SSN]`)
- **URLs**: Masks web addresses (e.g., `https://example.com` → `[URL]`)

#### Custom Names
Add specific names you want to mask:
- Click "Add" next to the custom name field
- Enter the name you want to mask
- The app will replace it with `[NAME]`

#### Custom Patterns
Create custom regex patterns for specific masking needs:

**Example Patterns:**
- **Username**: Pattern `\bmyusername\b` → Replacement `[USERNAME]`
- **Company**: Pattern `\bMyCompany\b` → Replacement `[COMPANY]`
- **API Key**: Pattern `sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{32}` → Replacement `[API_KEY]`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Auto-Start
Enable "Start monitoring on launch" to automatically begin monitoring when the app starts.

### Smart Content Detection
The app intelligently detects when sensitive content is the entire clipboard content vs. part of larger text. It only masks content when it's embedded within other text, preserving intentional copying of specific data types.

## 🛠️ Development

### Project Structure

### Key Components

- **ClipboardMonitor**: Handles clipboard monitoring and content masking
- **Settings**: Manages user preferences and custom patterns
- **ContentView**: Provides the menu bar interface and settings UI

### Adding New Masking Types

To add a new type of sensitive data to mask:

1. Add a new boolean property to `Settings.swift`
2. Add the masking logic in `ClipboardMonitor.anonymize()`
3. Add UI controls in `ContentView.swift`

## 🔒 Privacy

ClipboardMasking operates entirely on your local machine. No data is sent to external servers. All masking rules and settings are stored locally using UserDefaults.

## 🐛 Known Issues

- The app only monitors text content (not images or other data types)
- Some complex regex patterns may need fine-tuning for specific use cases


## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Built with SwiftUI and AppKit
- Inspired by the need for better clipboard privacy
- Thanks to the macOS development community
